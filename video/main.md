### Video 1: Networks in Online Games by Junxuan Hu

Junxuan delivers a comprehensive presentation on the networking aspects of online games, covering various models and architectures. The content is well-structured, and the explanations of client-server and peer-to-peer models, synchronization, and latency improvement techniques are clear and informative. The inclusion of relevant examples, such as Minecraft multiplayer and FPS games, enhances understanding. To further engage the audience, Junxuan could consider incorporating more pauses and emphasizing key points for clarity. Additionally, a clearer division of sections or headings would enhance the organization and flow of the presentation.

### Video 2: WebSocket by Steven He

Steven delivers a concise and informative presentation on WebSocket, covering its main features, connection process, usage, drawbacks, and future prospects. The content is well-presented, and the inclusion of examples like Phoenix Live View and Rails Hotwire adds practical context. In terms of improvement, it would be beneficial to enhance the visual aspect of the presentation by incorporating diagrams or illustrations to aid in understanding the WebSocket protocol and its components. Additionally, incorporating real-world case studies or examples of popular online games would make the presentation more engaging for the audience.

### Video 3: Asymmetric Key Encryption and RSA by Zhuohan Zhou

Zhuohan provides a clear overview of asymmetric key encryption and the RSA algorithm. The presentation effectively explains the principles of public-key cryptography and the generation of public and private keys in RSA. The visuals, such as formulas and diagrams, contribute to understanding the encryption and decryption processes. Mentioning the historical significance of RSA and the importance of key size adds context to the topic. However, the presentation could benefit from a clearer structure and smoother transitions between topics. Some technical terms could be defined more explicitly, and Zhuohan could further elaborate on the significance of prime numbers in RSA.
